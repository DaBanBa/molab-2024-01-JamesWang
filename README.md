Week 1 - Swift Introduction Reflection
  this week, I spent around 4 to 5 hours reviewing the 100 days of swiftUI, which I found very similar to python in both syntax and structures. I also did a short textArt with Xcode playground. I had a lot of fun learning, writing, and reviewing this information, and I think I got a pretty good grasp of it.
